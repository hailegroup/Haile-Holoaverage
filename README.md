# Haile-Holoaverage
Edit of Niermann and Lehmann's Holoaverage to include filter for biprism Fresnel fringes and Tkinter-based GUI for setting reconstruction parameters
Run "python main.py tkinter" to use GUI for selecting reconstruction parameters. Tkinter requires Hyperspy library.

See https://github.com/niermann/holoaverage for documentation
